    "Article Title": "Effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on Mental Health and Resiliency of Migrant Live-in Caregivers in Canada: Pilot Randomized Wait List Controlled Trial",
    "Abstract": "Background: Temporary migrant live-in caregivers constitute a vulnerable stream of temporary foreign workers in Canada. This is because the majority are racialized women from the Global South, the gendered nature of caregiving work has historically been undervalued, and their working and living spheres are intertwined which makes application of labor laws and surveillance almost impossible. Their invisible position in the fabric of Canadian society along with their precarious employment and immigration status place their mental health at jeopardy. There is a paucity of research about psychological support for this population.Objective: Our pilot study Women Empowerment-Caregiver Acceptance and Resilience E-Learning (WE2CARE) aimed to assess the efficacy of a 6-week online delivery of a psychological intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in reducing psychological distress and promoting resiliency among live-in care givers in the Greater Toronto Area.Methods: A pilot randomized wait list controlled design was used. Participants were recruited by two community peer champions working with community health organizations serving migrant live-in caregivers. A total of 36 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention and wait list control groups; 7 dropped out of the study due to competing life priorities. Standardized self-reported surveys were administered online pre-, post-, and 6-week postintervention to assess mental distress (DASS-21), psychological flexibility (AAQ-2), mindfulness (CAMS-R), and Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR-I). Independent and dependent t tests were used to compare study outcomes at pre, post, and 6-week follow-up across and within both arms of the study. Linear mixed effects models were created for each outcome of interest from baseline to postintervention among intervention and control participants. Self-reported impact of the WE2CARE intervention was examined using independent t tests across the study arms.Results: Average age of participants was 38 years. Many were born in the Philippines (23/29, 79%). The data on the impact of the psychological intervention showed a lower level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the intervention group compared with the control. However, the differences were not significant due to small sample size and COVID-19 crisis (6.94 vs 9.50, P=.54; 6.94 vs 10.83, P=.20; 7.76 vs 10.33, P=.44, respectively). There was a significant improvement in mindful qualities and external resilience, particularly in life satisfaction and accessible support among the intervention group (37.18 vs 32.92, t(22)=2.35, P=.03; 20.29 vs 16.5, t(21)=2.98, P=.007; 8.47 vs 6.75, t(14)=2.41, P=.03; 7.59 vs 5.33, t(16)=.008, respectively).Conclusions: WE2CARE is among the first studies exploring the efficacy of online delivery of ACT in addressing mental health challenges among live-in caregivers. While there are increased web-based ACT interventions, few use group videoconferencing to promote peer connection and mutual support. WE2CARE showed promising results in reducing psychological distress and promoting mindfulness and resiliency. The intervention highly motivated participants to engage collectively in building social support networks.",
